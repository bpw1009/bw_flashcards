Question,Answer
What is a null hypothesis (H₀)?,A statement of no effect or no difference that we attempt to reject with evidence
What is an alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)?,The statement we want to prove that contradicts the null hypothesis
What is a Type I error?,Rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive)
What is a Type II error?,Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative)
What is the significance level (α)?,The probability of making a Type I error (commonly 0.05 or 0.01)
What is statistical power?,The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (1 - β)
What is a p-value?,The probability of observing results at least as extreme as ours if H₀ is true
When do we reject the null hypothesis?,When the p-value is less than the significance level (p < α)
What is a test statistic?,A standardized value calculated from sample data used to test hypotheses
What is a one-tailed test?,A test where the alternative hypothesis specifies a direction (greater than or less than)
What is a two-tailed test?,A test where the alternative hypothesis doesn't specify a direction (not equal to)
What is the critical value?,The boundary value that separates the rejection region from the non-rejection region
What is a confidence interval?,A range of values that likely contains the true population parameter
How does a 95% confidence interval relate to α = 0.05?,If the null value is outside the 95% CI then we reject H₀ at α = 0.05
What is the difference between z-test and t-test?,Z-test uses known population variance; t-test uses sample variance
When do we use a t-test instead of a z-test?,When population standard deviation is unknown or sample size is small (n < 30)
What are the assumptions for a one-sample t-test?,Data is continuous normally distributed and observations are independent
What is a paired t-test used for?,Comparing means of the same subjects before and after treatment
What is an independent samples t-test?,A test comparing means between two separate groups
What does 'fail to reject H₀' mean?,We don't have enough evidence to conclude the alternative is true
Why don't we say 'accept the null hypothesis'?,Because absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
What is the relationship between Type I and Type II errors?,As Type I error decreases Type II error increases (for fixed sample size)
What is effect size?,A measure of the magnitude of difference independent of sample size
What is Cohen's d?,A standardized effect size measure: difference in means divided by pooled SD
What is a chi-square test used for?,Testing relationships between categorical variables
What are degrees of freedom in a t-test?,The number of independent values that can vary (usually n-1 for one sample)
What is the Central Limit Theorem's role in hypothesis testing?,It allows us to assume normality of sample means for large samples
What happens to the p-value as sample size increases?,It tends to decrease for a fixed effect size making rejection more likely
What is multiple testing correction?,Adjusting significance level when conducting multiple hypothesis tests
What is the Bonferroni correction?,Dividing α by the number of tests to control family-wise error rate
What is ANOVA used for?,Testing whether means differ among three or more groups
What is the null hypothesis in ANOVA?,All group means are equal (μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃ = ... = μₖ)
What is a non-parametric test?,A test that doesn't assume a specific distribution for the data
When would you use a Mann-Whitney U test?,Non-parametric alternative to independent t-test for non-normal data
What is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test?,Non-parametric alternative to paired t-test
What is statistical significance vs practical significance?,Statistical: p < α; Practical: the effect is large enough to matter
What is the standard error?,The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic
How do you calculate the z-score for hypothesis testing?,z = (x̄ - μ₀) / (σ/√n)
How do you calculate the t-statistic?,t = (x̄ - μ₀) / (s/√n)
What is the rejection region?,The range of test statistic values that lead to rejecting H₀
For α = 0.05 in a two-tailed z-test what are the critical values?,±1.96
For α = 0.05 in a one-tailed z-test what is the critical value?,1.645 (right tail) or -1.645 (left tail)
What assumption do we make about variance in a two-sample t-test?,Either equal variances (pooled) or unequal variances (Welch's)
What is heteroscedasticity?,Unequal variance across groups or values of predictor
What is the null hypothesis for a correlation test?,The population correlation ρ = 0
What does p = 0.03 mean in hypothesis testing?,There's a 3% chance of seeing results this extreme if H₀ is true
Can you prove the null hypothesis is true?,No you can only fail to find evidence against it
What factors affect statistical power?,Effect size sample size significance level and variance
Why is a larger sample size better for hypothesis testing?,It increases power and reduces standard error
What's the difference between one-way and two-way ANOVA?,One-way tests one factor; two-way tests two factors and their interaction
